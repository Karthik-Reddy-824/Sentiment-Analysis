Sentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone of text. It is widely used in:
Customer Reviews (e.g., analyzing feedback for movies, products, or services)
Social Media Monitoring (e.g., tracking public opinions on Twitter or Facebook)
Brand Sentiment Analysis (e.g., measuring customer satisfaction)
It typically categorizes text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments using NLP models such as TextBlob, VADER, or deep learning-based models.
This analysis helps in understanding the tone of Netflix content descriptions and how it has evolved over time. The overall increase in content with a positive sentiment suggests Netflix's focus on marketing content in an appealing way.
